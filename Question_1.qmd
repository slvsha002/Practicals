Find all rows in “airquality” that have missing values. Note that the airquality dataset in R is always available (just type airquality in the console to see it).

## Get the data


```{r}
data_airquality <- airquality
```

## Find the rows with missing values
```{r}
missing_rows <- data_airquality[!complete.cases(data_airquality), ]
```
The rows with missing values are shown below:
```{r}
#| echo: false
print(missing_rows)
```
